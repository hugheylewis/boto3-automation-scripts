# boto3-automation-scripts
A series of Python scripts built upon the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to automate AWS tasks

## Setup
1. Install the AWS CLI on your localhost. You can either download from http://aws.amazon.com/cli/ or use `sudo apt install awscli`
2. Run `aws configure`. In your AWS environment, grab your AWS Access Key ID, Access Key Value, and your default region.
    Follow [This AWS documentation](https://repost.aws/knowledge-center/create-access-key) for assistance with creating an IAM user and an associated access key
4. `git clone` this repository, `cd` into the directory, and install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
